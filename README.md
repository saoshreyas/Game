City Without Walls is a turn-based, multi-stakeholder strategy simulation where **five competing interest groups** attempt to influence city policy on homelessness. The game models the real-world complexity of homelessness as a **wicked problem**—full of uncertainty, unintended consequences, political pressure, resource constraints, and conflicting incentives.

Players take turns executing actions that alter interconnected metrics such as Public Support, Homeless Population, Legal Pressure, Budget Levels, Stakeholder Reputation, and Infrastructure Capacity. Progress requires navigating political trade-offs, unpredictable outcomes, and a fragile urban ecosystem.

# Game Overview

City Without Walls places you in a midsized American city facing a homelessness crisis after a violent incident sparks political upheaval. Five powerful stakeholders now compete to shape the city’s response.

Each player controls one stakeholder group:

* **Neighborhood Coalitions**
* **Business District Alliance**
* **Medical Quarter Leadership**
* **Shelters & Service Providers**
* **University / Research Consortium**

All groups **want homelessness reduced**, but each also protects its own interests—budget, reputation, influence, or stability.

To win, the *city* must achieve:

* **30% reduction** in homelessness
* **Public Support ≥ 50%**
* **Legal Pressure < 20**

Failure to maintain political or social stability can lead to collapse.

# Core Metrics

Your actions influence a dynamic system of interdependent metrics:

### **Homelessness Metrics**

* **Total Homeless Population**
* **Unsheltered Population**
* **Sheltered Population**
* **At-Risk Population** (those at imminent risk of homelessness)

### **Citywide Metrics**

* **Public Support**
* **Legal Pressure**
* **Policy Fatigue** (public resistance to frequent spending/changes)
* **Policy Momentum** (city’s readiness to adopt new programs)
* **Economy Strength** (affects budget inflow)

### **Infrastructure Metrics**

* **Bed Capacity**
* **Construction Queue** (multi-turn projects)

### **Stakeholder Metrics**

Each role has its own:

* **Budget**
* **Reputation / Influence**
* **Role-Specific Variables** (e.g., Property Values, Customer Traffic, Clinic Capacity, Volunteer Count, University Reputation)

---

# Roles and Objectives

Each stakeholder has unique actions, incentives, and loss risks.

---

# Neighborhood Coalitions

### **Primary Goal:** Reduce visible street homelessness while protecting property values and safety.

### **Secondary Goals:** Maintain high public support, minimize legal conflicts, protect neighborhood reputation.

### **Lose Conditions to Avoid:**

* Public Support falls below 35%
* Neighborhood safety perception collapses
* Excessive use of punitive actions increases legal pressure

---

## Neighborhood Actions & Strategy

### **Launch Media Campaign (Cost: Budget)**

**Effects:** Boosts public support, slightly reduces visible homelessness.
**Strategy:** Powerful political tool. Helps guide city-wide attitudes and influence other stakeholders indirectly.

### **Fund Private Security (Cost: Moderate)**

**Effects:** Reduces local homelessness but **pushes unsheltered individuals into other zones**.
**Strategy:** Effective but risky—can backfire by increasing chronic homelessness citywide.

### **Sponsor Local Outreach (Cost: Low)**

**Effects:** Improves public sentiment and slightly reduces unsheltered count.
**Strategy:** Good long-term trust-building alternative to punitive approaches.

### **Pass**

**Effects:** Public support drops.
**Strategy:** Dangerous; avoid when possible.

---

# Business District Alliance

### **Primary Goal:** Keep streets clean, maintain customer flow, and avoid economic decline.

### **Secondary Goals:** Reduce visible homelessness around businesses, improve cleanliness index.

### **Lose Conditions to Avoid:**

* Customer traffic falls too low
* Cleanliness index collapses
* Reputation damage from aggressive actions

---

## Business District Actions & Strategy

### **Sanitation & Encampment Sweeps (Cost: Moderate)**

**Effects:** Clears streets temporarily; increases legal pressure; may worsen chronic homelessness.
**Strategy:** High-impact but risky—should be timed carefully.

### **Job Readiness Programs (Cost: Medium)**

**Effects:** Reduces at-risk population and improves public support.
**Strategy:** Balanced action that supports stability without backlash.

### **Deploy Street Ambassadors (Cost: Low)**

**Effects:** Guides unhoused individuals to shelters; increases sheltered population.
**Strategy:** Gentle, trust-building approach.

### **Pass**

**Effects:** Cleanliness index worsens.

---

# Medical Quarter Leadership

### **Primary Goal:** Improve health outcomes and reduce ER strain.

### **Secondary Goals:** Maintain clinic capacity, manage treatment costs.

### **Lose Conditions to Avoid:**

* Clinic overload
* Treatment costs exceeding budget

---

## Medical Quarter Actions & Strategy

### **Open Health Clinics (Cost: High)**

**Effects:** Improves health outcomes and reduces long-term homelessness.
**Strategy:** Expensive but essential for addressing root causes.

### **Expand Mental Health Services (Cost: Medium-High)**

**Effects:** Reduces chronic homelessness over time.
**Strategy:** High long-term impact; helps stabilize the system.

### **Mobile Medical Teams (Cost: Low-Medium)**

**Effects:** Reduces unsheltered deaths and improves stability.
**Strategy:** Good emergency tool.

### **Pass**

**Effects:** Patient volume worsens.

---

# Shelters & Service Providers

### **Primary Goal:** Increase capacity and connect people to services.

### **Secondary Goals:** Maintain volunteer count, avoid collapse of shelter systems.

### **Lose Conditions to Avoid:**

* Bed capacity falls below minimum needs
* Operating budget depleted

---

## Shelters & Services Actions & Strategy

### **Volunteer Drive (Cost: Low)**

**Effects:** Boosts volunteer count and reduces homelessness slightly.
**Strategy:** Staple action—cheap and reliable.

### **Expand Bed Capacity (Cost: High + construction delay)**

**Effects:** Increases capacity but takes multiple turns.
**Strategy:** Crucial for long-term success. Requires coordination.

### **Partner with Medical or University (Cost: Varies)**

**Effects:** Unlocks shared benefits, improves outcomes.
**Strategy:** Collaboration yields compounding advantages.

### **Pass**

**Effects:** Capacity wears down.

---

# University / Research Consortium

### **Primary Goal:** Improve research impact while maintaining reputation.

### **Secondary Goals:** Increase community engagement, avoid political backlash.

### **Lose Conditions to Avoid:**

* Reputation drops too low
* Research becomes politically risky

---

## University Actions & Strategy

### **Student Outreach & Research Initiative (Cost: Low)**

**Effects:** Improves data accuracy, small public support gain.
**Strategy:** Low-risk, high-information play.

### **Pilot Programs with City (Cost: Medium)**

**Effects:** Medium homelessness reduction; may cause controversy if outcomes poor.
**Strategy:** Strong but reputation-sensitive.

### **Reputation Management (Cost: Medium)**

**Effects:** Mitigates damage from failed studies.
**Strategy:** Use after risky or controversial actions.

### **Pass**

**Effects:** Reputation drops.

# Key Game Mechanics

## Turn Structure

* Turn order is determined by political influence.
* Each turn, exactly one stakeholder acts.
* Background systems update automatically.
* Random events and economic shocks may occur.
* Game continues until victory or collapse.

## Construction Pipeline

* Capacity expansions take multiple turns.
* Projects appear in a construction queue.

## Operating Costs

* Shelters incur ongoing costs.
* Failing to pay leads to capacity degradation.

## Policy Fatigue

* Repeated spending reduces public willingness for more initiatives.

## Random Events

Possible events include:

* Economic recession
* Budget surplus
* Severe weather
* Public protests

# Advanced Strategic Considerations

### **Cross-Role Synergy**

* Business + Shelters = outreach + job programs synergy
* Medical + University = research-informed health initiatives
* Neighborhoods + Business = public support + visibility reduction

### **Managing Unintended Consequences**

Punitive approaches may:

* Increase chronic homelessness
* Raise legal pressure
* Lower public support

### **Economic Timing**

Major actions should align with:

* Budget surpluses
* High policy momentum

### **Political Pressure**

Maintaining public support is essential for preventing citywide collapse.

* Housing-first research
* Impacts of criminalization
* Role of medical respite care
* Research ethics and reputation
* Urban economic pressures

The game’s complexity mirrors real policymaking: intertwined, uncertain, and politically constrained.
