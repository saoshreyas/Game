 '''# Coverage Clash: How to Play

## Game Overview
Coverage Clash simulates the competing forces in U.S. healthcare access between Policy Makers (who aim to improve healthcare access) and Insurance Companies (who aim to maximize profit). This turn-based strategy game models real-world healthcare policy dynamics with multiple interconnected metrics that players must carefully manage.

Players take turns executing actions that affect seven key metrics: Uninsured Rate, Public Health Index, Access Gap Index, Insurance Profit, Public Trust Meter, Insurance Influence, and Policy Maker Budget. Success requires understanding how actions create cascading effects across all metrics while managing both immediate needs and long-term strategic positioning.

Hidden Game Mechanics (can't give away too much but just a little hint)

Policy Makers have the ability to acess bonus turns, but it's not up to them but their consituents

Insurance Companies thrive off of public distrust of the government and the public's trust in them

Remember, every action has a reaction and there's always more than one way to win this game!

Real-World Context
The game incorporates several real-world healthcare policy dynamics:
- Lobbying Power: Insurance companies' ability to influence policy through lobbying 
- Public Opinion: How trust affects political viability of health policies  
- Budget Constraints: Government funding limitations for health programs
- Market Dynamics: How insurance practices affect access and outcomes
- Corruption: How special interests can redirect public resources
